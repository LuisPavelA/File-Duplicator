# Guide


## Put your file into the file duplicator folder (For example: Drag example.txt into Downloads\File-Duplicator-main\File-Duplicator-main\).


## 1. Open main.py, and then you will see a screen.
### This is the file duplicator.


## 2. In the slot below the text, "File Name (without extension)".
### Enter in the slot below the name of the file without the extension (For example: Type "example" only).


## 3. In the second slot below the text, "File Extension (without dot)".
### Enter in the slot below the extension of the file that you want to copy (For example: Type ".txt" only).


## 4. There is a 3rd slot below the text, "Copies".
### In the slot below insert the number of files you want to copy (For example: "10" will make 10 copies of "example.txt" and "50" will make 50 copies of "example.txt").


## 5. Then you will see a button at the bottom that says, "Duplicate".
## Click it and then you are done!
### For more information of the file copies you can open a file called logs.txt and it will display info.


### That's all for using the file duplicator. Have a nice day.
