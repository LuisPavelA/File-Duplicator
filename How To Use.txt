This is for people who don't know/understand how to use it


Put your file into the file duplicator folder (For example: Drag example.txt into Downloads\File-Duplicator-main\File-Duplicator-main\).

Next open main.py, and then you will see a screen.
This is the file duplicator.

In the slot below the text, "File Name (without extension)".
Enter in the slot below the name of the file without the extension (For example: Type "example" only).
In the second slot below the text, "File Extension (without dot)".
Enter in the slot below the extension of the file that you want to copy (For example: Type ".txt" only).
There is a 3rd slot below the text, "Copies".
Enter in the slot below the number of files you want to copy (For example: "10" will make 10 copies of "example.txt" and "50" will make 50 copies of "example.txt").

Then you will see a button at the bottom that says, "Duplicate".
Click it and then you are done!
For more information of the file copies you can open a file called logs.txt and it will display info.

That's all for using the file duplicator. Have a nice day.
